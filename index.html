                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is simply a place for me to put all my Frontend Mentor projects. The links are listed in the order in which I completed them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page is a work in process. It gives me something to play around with, change, manipulate, and screw up when I am bored. So please be patient. This page, like fine wine, will improve with age (I hope).
                    </p>

                    <h3>(07/10/24)</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Total overhaul of this site and it's GitHub Repository. Instead of having seperate GitHub Repositories for each Frontend Mentor Project I combined all of the projects into the FM Landing Page Repository. That really cleaned up my GitHub site. And from here on out I will just add any new Frontend Mentor projects to this Page and Repository. This was a major task as it involved moving all the files from the six individual Repositories to the FM Landing Page Repository. And then deleting all the .git and.gitignore files except for those related to the FM Landing Page site (otherwise everybody would be confused). And to make it more challenging it also involved updating six solution submissions on the Frontend Mentor website because all the corresponding links were effectively killed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>(07-11-24)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Moved the Product Preview Card files to the FM Landing Page Repoditory. Updated and Validated the Landing Page code. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>(07-13-24)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Moved the files from the other five projects to the FM Landing Page Repository. Added the new links to those projects on the FM Landing Page code and made sure they all worked.
