                        This is simply a place for me to put all my Frontend Mentor projects. They are listed in the order in which I completed them.

                        This page is a work in process. It gives me something to play around with, change, manipulate, and screw up when I am bored. So please be patient. This page, like wine, will improve with age (I hope).

                        (07/10/24) Total overhaul of this site and it's Repository. Instead of having seperate Repositories for each Frontend Mentor Project I combined all of them into the FM Landing Page Repository. And from here on out I will just add any new Frontend Mentor projects to this Page and Repository. This was a major task as it involved deleting all related Repositories on GitHub and then creating a new FM Landing Page Repository. And to make it more challenging it also involved updating six solution submissions on the Frontend Mentor website.
