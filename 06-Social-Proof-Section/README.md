## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code (my code editor of choice most of the time)
- Zoner Photo Studio X (for viewing the Design Files)
- PicPick (especially the RULER for measuring various things in the Design Files)
- Paint.net (for various image related work)
- GitHub (for storing the code online)

### I am learning

- More of the capabilities that Visual Studio Code has.

- Using GitHub (particularily Commiting and Publishing from VSC). This is challenging as GitHub is very powerful and complex. If I don't use it on a regular basis I forget how to do the things I did last time I used it. And GitHub is still one of the most un-intuative things I have ever seen.

- Using .gitignore (and how to exclude the files I don't need to publish to GitHub)

- Creating an effective and informative README file.



### Continued development

- This is the first time I delved deeper into FLEX using flex-start and flex-end. It was a bit of trial and error at first, but it all came together. I will be working to learn more and more about FLEX.

- I NEED to do more pre-coding layout work. By that I mean I need to actually draw out the layout design on a piece of paper. Then I can actually visualize each component and the best use for margins and padding for those components.

- I need to get back to coding on a daily basis. After all, practice makes perfect. Well, in my case, practice makes me a little better than yesterday.


### Useful resources

- [PicPick](https://picpick.app/en/) - I'm cheap so I don't get the Figma files. That means the only design reference I have is the Design Preview Images. Using the Pixel Ruler in PicPick gives me the ability to measure various things in the design images.

- Any good Image Viewing Program - I use Zoner Photo Studio X.
